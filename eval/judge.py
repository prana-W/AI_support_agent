eval/judge.py — LLM-as-judge for reply quality evaluation.

Uses gemini-3.1-flash-lite via LangChain to score agent replies on 4 dimensions:
  - relevance:     Does the reply address the customer's actual problem? (1–5)
  - groundedness:  Is the reply grounded in real Amazon policies/tone, no hallucinations? (1–5)
  - tone:          Is the reply empathetic, professional, not defensive? (1–5)
  - conciseness:   Is the reply appropriately concise for Twitter support? (1–5)

Also provides a composite score (mean of 4 dimensions).

Standalone — does NOT import from app/. Reads config from environment variables.

Score the following agent reply on 4 dimensions, each from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).

Customer Message:
"{message}"

Customer's Intent:
"{intent}"

Agent Reply Being Evaluated:
"{reply}"

Scoring Rubric:
- relevance (1–5): Does the reply directly address the customer's specific problem? 1=completely off-topic, 5=directly addresses all concerns.
- groundedness (1–5): Is the reply factually grounded? Does it avoid hallucinating order numbers, policies, or promises Amazon can't keep? 1=fabricates facts, 5=accurate and careful.
- tone (1–5): Is the reply empathetic, professional, and non-defensive? 1=cold/defensive/dismissive, 5=warm, understanding, and helpful.
- conciseness (1–5): Is the reply appropriately brief for Twitter support? 1=far too long or too short to be useful, 5=perfectly sized with no filler.
